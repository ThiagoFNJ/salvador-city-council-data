# Have you ever wondered how much a city councilor costs?

Back in 2018, choosing my candidate for councilor for the municipal elections, I asked myself this question. The quick answer you can find in a google search: according to the federal constitution, the salary of a councilor must vary between 20% and 75% of the salary of a state deputy, something between R$ 5,621.39 and R$ 21,080.21 per month (US$1098,27 - US$4118,48).

But in reality, the cost is much higher. In addition to his salary, a councilor is entitled to a team of freely chosen and appointed advisors, travel costs, among other things.

Still in 2018, I looked for the salary of advisors of councilors with a term in force, and I was surprised by the non-availability of this information. The website of the Municipality of Salvador (CMS) simply did not make them available, which goes against the Access to Information Law in force since 2011.

Approximately 4 years later, this information is finally available on the official CMS portal, but in a non-parsable format (PDF).

The objective of this project is to gather some of this public information, extracting it, cleaning it and making it available in an easy to analyze format.
